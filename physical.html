        <p class="font1"> Physical well-being is much more than good health. It is the direct result of lifestyle choices and our behaviors around sleep, diet, physical activity, hygiene, and relaxation that achieve or derail optimal functioning. Do you wake up full of energy and optimism for the day and feel confident about your ability to handle whatever comes your way? Or are you often distracted by pain, headaches, discomfort, and fatigue? Maybe you struggle to complete tasks because you feel foggy or run out of steam. Physical well-being drives all of that. <br><br>

            It can be tempting to say “that’s just the nature of working long hours” or “I’m not as young as I used to be,” and assume you can’t feel better or perform better or that everyone else feels just the same. But physical well-being can be improved. You can have chronic illness or disability and still have well-being. The decisions and the actions we take affect strength, appearance, hardiness, longevity, resilience, happiness, and your ability to achieve You Inc.’s goal of life satisfaction.<br><br>
            
            Yes, avoiding illness is important, but sometimes it is out of your control. Genetics and random illness can be real threats to You Inc., but as CEO you still have the power to pivot, take actions to optimize your functioning, and keep moving toward your goals. Paying attention to your physical well-being is like making an investment today in the resources that will help you weather and leverage whatever comes your way--good well-being gives you more assets to tap into. CEOs persevere. They stay nimble. 
            
            <br><br>
            How do you achieve physical well-being?<br>
            Since physical well-being has many components there are limitless ways to improve it. For example:<br>
            
            1.Eating well<br>
            2.Exercising<br>
            3.Getting enough sleep<br>
            4.Staying hydrated<br>
            5.Drinking in moderation<br><br>
            
            Depending on your needs, you can design a plan that may focus solely on one aspect of your life, like increasing physical activity. Or your plan can cover a wide range of initiatives for a more cumulative approach that also includes eating more vegetables, going to bed at the same time each night, and cutting back on alcohol. The bottom line is improving overall physical well-being for the benefit of You Inc.
            <br><br>
            Be sure to focus on your strengths and not your weaknesses. This seems counterintuitive to making health improvements but when we apply our strengths to areas that need development we are more likely to be successful.
