            Skin is the body’s largest organ. When healthy, its layers work hard to protect us. But when it’s compromised, the skin’s ability to work as an effective barrier is impaired. We have therefore found the best ways to improve skin health to support it in maintaining its protective role. <br><br>

            With a few simple alterations to your skincare routine, you could have radiant-looking skin in no time.<br>
            Your skin is the window to your body that reveals the stories of your life. From acne breakouts during your teenage years to the radiant glow of pregnancy and the sunspots of aging, both your age and your health are reflected in your skin.
            <br><br>
            1. Eat a healthful diet<br>
            There is a multibillion-dollar industry dedicated to products that keep your skin looking its best, and which claim to fight signs of aging. But moisturizers only go skin deep, and aging develops at a deeper, cellular level.
            
            What you eat is as important as the products that you put on your skin. Your diet could improve your skin health from the inside out, so a clear complexion begins with eating a healthful diet.<br>
            
            Skin-healthy foods
            Here are some foods that have been acknowledged by research as being skin-healthy.
            
            Mangoes contain compounds with antioxidant properties. These compounds help to protect components of the skin, such as collagen.<br>
            
            Tomatoes have skin cancer-prevention benefits. One studyTrusted Source in mice revealed that daily tomato consumption decreased the development of skin cancer tumors by 50 percent after UV light exposure.
            <br><br>
            2. Keep stress in check<br>
            Have you ever noticed that right before an important event, an unsightly pimple appears on your face? Well, scientists have identified some links between stress levels and skin problems.
            
            The researchers suspect that stress increases the quantity of sebum, which is the oily substance that blocks pores. This, in turn, leads to greater acne severity.
            
            Reducing your stress levels may lead to clearer skin. If you think that stress is having an impact on your skin, try stress reduction techniques such as tai chi, yoga, or meditation.
            <br><br>
            3. Keep moisture in the skin<br>
            Skin moisturizers keep the top layer of skin cells hydrated and seal in moisture. Moisturizers often contain humectants to attract moisture, occlusive agents to retain moisture in the skin, and emollients to smooth the spaces between skin cells.
            <br><br>
            4. Quit smoking<br>
            Smoking ages facial skinTrusted Source and skin located in other body areasTrusted Source. Smoking narrows the blood vessels found in the outer layer of the skin, which reduces blood flow and exhausts the skin of the nutrients and oxygen it needs to remain healthy.
            
            Qutting smoking can improve your skin health and prevent smoking-related wrinkles from forming.
            Collagen and elastin give the skin its strength and elasticity. Smoking may reduce the natural elasticity of the skin by causing the breakdown of collagen and reduction of collagen production.
            
            If you currently smoke, the best thing that you can do for your skin health is quit. You can visit Smokefree.gov, an initiative from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), for information about quitting smoking.
            <br><br>
            5. Get your beauty sleep<br>
            Getting your beauty sleep will banish those dark circles around your eyes and improve your skin tone, and, best of all, it is free.
            
            Getting the recommended hours of sleep could do wonders for your complexion.
            The National Sleep Foundation recommend that adults sleep for between 7 and 9 hours every day. Sleeping for under that amount of time could be detrimental to your health — and your skin, in particular.<br>
            
            Chronic sleep deprivation is known to be linked with obesity, immune deficiency, diabetes, and cancer, but research has shown that sleep quality may also have a significant impact on skin function and aging.
            
            People classed as poor sleepers had increased signs of premature skin aging and a decreased ability for their skin to repair itself at night from environmental stressors such as sun exposure.<br>
            
            During deep sleep, your body enters repair mode and regenerates skin, muscles, and blood and brain cells. Without adequate sleep, your body is unable to produce new collagen. Collagen prevents your skin from sagging.
            
            Try to get an early night and sleep for a full 7 hours to look your best.
            <br><br>
            Keeping your skin healthy and young does not necessarily mean breaking the bank by purchasing expensive creams and lotions; by following these simple steps, you can make dull and lifeless skin glow.
